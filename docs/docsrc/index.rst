What is MontyCarlo?
-------------------

**MontyCarlo** is a python framework for setting up simulations and/or developing applications whose basis is the simulation of particle transport. It simulates the propagation and effects of ionizing radiation (`photons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon>`_, `electrons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron>`_ and `positrons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron>`_ with energies between 1keV and 1GeV) in matter of homogeneous density, filling `constructive solid geometry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry>`_) models.


MontyCarlo belongs to a family of monte carlo codes widely used in Medical Physics research for the determination of the effects of ionizing radiation on the body. The difference to its predecessors lyes in the projects vision, which is completely aligned with the philosophy of the Python programming language.
