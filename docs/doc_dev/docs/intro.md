# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **MontyCarlo in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new project**.

Or **try MontyCarlo immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new project

Generate a new MontyCarlo project using the following command:

```shell
myco new name_of_project
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
