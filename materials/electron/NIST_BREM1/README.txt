# NIST bremsstrahlung cross sections as a function of electron energy and outgoing
# photon energy (in reduced photon energy = outgoing photon enrgy/ electron enrgy).
# Cross sections are in [mbarn] units.
# S. M. SELTZER, NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS, 5 SEP 84.
# Number of Z = 1-92 // indicated by the end of the file names
# Number of electron energies = 57; 1keV-10GeV  // the grid is in 'nist_brems_grid' in [MeV] units
# Number of (reduced) photon energies = 32; 0-1 // the grid is in 'nist_brems_grid'
# Each file contains data for the given Z, 57x32 bremsstrahlung x-sections in [mbarn] units.
