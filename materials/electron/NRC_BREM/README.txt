# NRC bremsstrahlung cross sections as a function of electron energy and outgoing
# photon energy (in reduced photon energy = outgoing photon enrgy/ electron enrgy).
# Cross sections are in [mbarn] units.
# F. Tessier, I. Kawrakow NIMB 266 (2008) 625-634 (more accurate electron-electron bremsstrahlung
# part; significant difference below 1 [MeV] compared to the NIST i.e. Seltzer-Berger cross sections.)
# Number of Z = 1-100 // indicated by the end of the file names
# Number of electron energies = 49; 1keV-10GeV  // the grid is in 'nrc_brems_grid' in [MeV] units
# Number of (reduced) photon energies = 54; 0-1 // the grid is in 'nrc_brems_grid'
# Each file contains data for the given Z, 49x54 bremsstrahlung x-sections in [mbarn] units.
