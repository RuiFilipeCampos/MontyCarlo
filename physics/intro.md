## The Bare Minimum



A basic conceptual/mathematical framework is introduced, which is the minimum mathematical background required to understand how a Monte Carlo particle simulator is constructed. An attempt is made to build an **intuition** for what the *differential cross section* is and how it can be used in particle simulations. A bottom up approach is taken to walk the reader to the most important algorithm in the Monte Carlo techniques for the simulation of particle transport.


There are several simulation schemes. Monty Carlo uses two:

- Detailed history, also known as analogue simulation (for the simulation of photons);
- Condensed History (for the simulation of electrons and positrons).
