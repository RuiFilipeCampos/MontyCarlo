# Photoelectric Effect

The adopted differential cross section for the sampling the electrons direction is the Sauter differential cross section, derived using the the first-order plane-wave Born approximation with K-shell hydrogenic electron wave functions.


$$

        \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = 
        \alpha^4
        r_e^2
        \left ( 
            \frac{Z}{k} 
        \right ) ^ 5
        \frac{\beta^4}{\gamma}
        \frac{\sin^2 \theta}
        {(1-\beta \cos \theta)^4}
        \left [ 
            1
            +
            \frac{1}{2}
            \gamma
            (\gamma - 1)
            (\gamma - 2)
            (1 - \beta\cos\theta)
        \right ],
$$


where:

- $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant
- $r_e$ is the classical electron radius
- $Z$ is atomic number
- $k$ is the reduced photon energy $k = E/m_ec^2$
- $\beta$ is the (what's the name of this?) $\beta = v/c$
- $\theta$ is the polar angular of the emitted electron
