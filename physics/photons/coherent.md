# Coherent Scattering

## Thomson Scattering

Consider an incident electromagnetic plane wave on a free charged particle that is initially at rest. The EM wave can be written in versor notation

$$
\tilde \mathbf{E} = \hat \mathbf{ s} E_0 \exp \left ( 
i (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - wt)
\right )
$$

where $\hat \mathbf{ s}$ is the polarization of the field (which is linear), $E_0$ is the amplitude of the field, $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector (indicates the direction of propagation) and $w$ is the frequency of oscillation√ß. The actual value of the electric field can be extracted by taking the real part of $\tilde \mathbf{E}$, that is,

$$
\mathbf{E} = \textrm{Re}(
    \tilde \mathbf{E}
).
$$

Since the field is always pointing in the s-direction, which can be chosen to be any direction without loss of generality, the charge will be set in motion in that direction. Meaning that this is a 1d problem and only the s-coordinate needs to be considered. Using Newtons Law,

$$
m  \mathbf{a} \cdot \hat \mathbf{s} = e \textrm{Re}(
    \tilde \mathbf{E}
).
$$


## Rayleigh Scattering

The DCS:

$$
        \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} 
        =
        r_e^2 \frac{1 + \cos^2 \theta}{2} F_Z(q)^2,
$$
