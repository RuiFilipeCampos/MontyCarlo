# Class II Condensed History

:::caution

This stuff is still being written.

Consider an isotropic medium of atomic number density $N$.
Without loss of generality, any point in this medium can be chosen as the origin for the trajectory of some charged particle. 
Let $s$ be the displacement of the particle without interacting with the medium, $f(s; \mathbf{r}, \hat \mathbf{d})$ be the conditional probability density function of the random variable $(\mathbf{r}, \hat \mathbf{d})$ given that a displacement $s$ has occurred, where $\mathbf{r}  \in \mathbf{R}^3$ locates a point in space and $\hat \mathbf{d} \in S^2$ is the direction of the particle. The diffusion equation for this distribution can be written as

$$
    (\partial_s + \partial_{\hat \mathbf{d}} ) f(s; \mathbf{r}, \hat \mathbf{d})
    =
    N \sigma_{el} \int_{S^2} 
    \left [  
    f(s; \mathbf{r}, \hat \mathbf{d}) - f(s; \mathbf{r}, \hat \mathbf{d}(\theta', \phi')) 
    \right ] 
    p(\theta', \phi')
    d\Omega'
$$


where $\theta$ is the angle between $\hat \mathbf{d}$ and $\hat \mathbf{d}'$ and $\phi$ identifies rotations whose axis is $\hat d$, $p(\theta, \phi)$ is the probability density function of those values and is identified with the probabilistic model generated by the elastic scattering DCS.

The objective is to characterize the $f$-distribution in terms of its first and second moments. This will be relevant later when formulating the condensed history algorithm. Consider its harmonical expansion in $\hat \mathbf{d}$,
 

$$
    f(s; \mathbf{r}, \hat \mathbf{d}) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m = -l}^l f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r}) Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d})
$$


inserting it into the difusion equation results in



$$
    Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}) \partial_s f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    +
    f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r}) \partial_{\hat \mathbf{d}} Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}) \\
    =  \\
    N \sigma_{el} 
    f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    \int_{S^2}
    \left [  
    Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}) -  Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta', \phi')) 
    \right ] 
    p(\theta', \phi')
    d\Omega'
$$

where summation over $l$ and $m$ are assumed as stipulated by the harmonic expansion. Multiplying both sides by $Y_{\lambda}^{\mu}(\hat \mathbf{d})^*$ trivially results in



$$
    Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d})^* Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}) \partial_s f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    +
    \nabla_{\mathbf{r}} f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r}) \cdot Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d})^* \hat d Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d})
    \\
   =  \\
    N \sigma_{el} 
    f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    \int_{S^2}
    \left [  
    Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d})^* Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}) -  Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d})^* Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta', \phi')) 
    \right ] 
    p(\theta', \phi')
    d\Omega'
$$

where the $\partial_{\hat \mathbf{d}}$ has been decomposed into $\hat d \cdot \nabla_{\mathbf{r}}$. Carrying out an integration with respect to $\hat \mathbf{d}$ over the unit sphere ends up resulting in 

$$
    \delta_{\mu,m}\delta_{\lambda,l} \partial_s f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    +
    \nabla_{\mathbf{r}} f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{Q}_{\lambda \mu}^{lm}\\
   =  \\
    N \sigma_{el} 
    f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    \int_{(S^2)^2}
    \left [  
    Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta, \phi))^* Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta, \phi)) -  Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta, \phi))^* Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta', \phi')) 
    \right ] 
    p(\theta', \phi')
    d\Omega' d\Omega
$$


where $\mathbf{Q}_{\lambda \mu}^{lm}$ neatly packs the integration for later thinking I suppose,

$$
\mathbf{Q}_{\lambda \mu}^{lm} = \int_{S^2} Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta, \phi))^* \hat \mathbf{d}(\theta, \phi) Y_l^m(\hat \mathbf{d}(\theta, \phi)) d\Omega

$$




Consider the expansion of $p(\theta, \phi)$ in legendre polynomials


$$
    p(\theta, \phi) = \sum_n a_n(\phi) P_n(\phi; \cos \theta)
$$



:::caution
ok, so this is where im actually having trouble: the point is to reduce the equation to a problem for solving for the f_l^m coefficients. And I need to reduce the integration on the right side... The suggestion I've seen in the paper is to use legendre polynomials + addition theorem for harmonics. But I've been trying a lot and don't really see any easy way out of those integrals

and the addition theorem for spherical harmonics

$$    
P_l(\cos \theta) = \sum_{l} Y()T()
$$


$$
    f_l^m(s; \mathbf{r})
    \int_{(S^2)^2}
    \left [  
    Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat d)^* Y_l^m(\hat d) -  Y_\lambda^\mu(\hat d)^* Y_l^m(\hat d') 
    \right ] 
    P_n(\cos \theta)
